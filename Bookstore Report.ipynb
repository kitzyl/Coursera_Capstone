Identifying where potential customers are and bringing the business to them can help the money stay local and boost the local economy. Moreover, bookshops are more than just shops that sell books, but community spaces for literary and artistic events.\n\nSydney, Australia's most populous city, has the potential to sustain more physical bookshops than it currently has. In fact, Sydney and Melbourne (Australia's second most populous city) have been informally locked in a friendly competition over [which is the \"better\" city](https://www.google.com/search?q=sydney+vs+melbourne) for what feels like forever. From the weather to housing prices to their local coffee scenes, the comparisons between the cities have been endless and subject to an individual's preferences.\n\nOf particular interest to booklovers and booksellers is that Melbourne has been designated as an [UNESCO City of Literature](https://cityofliterature.com.au/) since 2008, cementing Melbourne's status as a vibrant hub of literary culture with local creative talents. This is furthermore backed up by Melbourne's abundant bookshops, in particular its independent shops as opposed to big chain stores.\n\nDespite its higher population (and therefore higher number of potential readers), Sydney seems to lag behind Melbourne in this creative pursuit. Assuming the percentage of readers remain constant across a population, one possibility for this discrepancy is that even though Sydney simply lacks the physical bookshops for them to show monetary support in, i.e. Sydneysiders shop for their books online more often than instore.\n\nThe analysis from this project aims to help potential booksellers identify Sydney areas where a bookshop is lacking yet sustainable, which will hopefully be one step closer transforming Sydney into a veritable literary city in its own right."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\nThere are many variables that can account for the number of bookshops in an area, such as education, gender, income, local transportation, surrounding amenities, population, etc. For the purposes of this project, we will only use Income as our main variable as it often correlates quite well to many of the aforementioned variables, e.g. literacy level can be linked to education level which in turn links to income level.\n\nWe used Foursquare data to identify existing bookshops within 7.5km of Melbourne and Sydney, as well as their locations in the form of postcodes. We also obtained data on the income of these particular suburbs via the [Australian Taxation Office](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/taxation-statistics-2017-18/resource/343f1d18-067b-44ee-b7b3-1b04c4872b86?inner_span=True) in the form of a .csv file."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Methodology\n\nFrom the data above, we cross-reference the locations of these bookshops by their postcodes with postcode data from [taxation data from the Australian Taxation Office](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/taxation-statistics-2017-18/resource/343f1d18-067b-44ee-b7b3-1b04c4872b86?inner_span=True). We extract the total income of those locations by multiplying the number of lodged tax returns and the average income.\n\nBy this method, we can find the total number of bookshops within 7.5km of the city centre as well as the total amount of income from those particular areas. Then applying the same analyses on Sydney bookshops and locations, we use the data from the Melbourne analyses to identify how many more bookshops can be opened and sustained in existing suburbs within 7.5km of Sydney based on the total income from those suburbs."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Results\n\nThere are 42 bookstores altogether within 7.5km of Melbourne, Victoria. The suburbs that the bookstores are in have a combined income of AUD12,518,946,363 from 178,399 individuals with taxable income (that is, an average income of AUD70,173).\n\nYet, within 7.5km of  Sydney, NSW, there are only 39 bookstores despite their suburbs having a combined income of AUD21,090,627,734 from  248,699 individuals with lodged incomes (with an average income of AUD84,803).\n\nWe assumed a linear correlation of y=mx+b with the dependent variable y being the number of bookstores and the independent  variable x as either the combined income or total individuals. We also assumed that 0 incomes/individual yield 0 bookstores, giving us that b=0.\n\n<b>Thus, by combined income alone, Sydney should be able to sustain 70 bookstores (rounded down from 70.76). By individuals alone (seeing that the average income in Sydney is higher than that of Melbournes), Sydney should be able to sustain 58 bookstores (rounded down from 58.55).</b>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Discussion\n\n<b>Cities are outliers.</b>\nEven though both cities have a higher density of bookstores at its centre, the total lodged incomes of the city suburbs are not the highest. This makes sense since these central suburbs are often business districts, where few people live in but a lot work in. These central business districts also benefit from a higher concentration of commercial areas (with their guaranteed higher volume of foot traffic), and a higher concentration of available public transport. Thus even though people do not live in the area, the consistent daily commuters to the city bring a constant stream of potential customers.\n\n<b>Public transport systems are integral to the survival of bookstores outside of city centres.</b>\nMelbourne has a well-known system of public transport (in particular its trams network) that offers a lot of different connections and covers a wide range of suburbs. Looking at the map of bookstores in Melbourne, we can observe that many of the bookstores outside of the city centre lies on or close to a route with public transport.\n\n<b>Types of bookstores.</b>\nIn this analysis, any shop that sold books were included as a bookstore, regardless of the types of books the sold. Looking at the list of bookshops within 7.5 km of Melbourne and Sydney, we infer the following: (a) Melbourne has lots of Book Grocers (a discount bookstore) and local independent bookshops in the heart of the city (such as Readings and Hill of Content), and (b) Sydney has lots of newsagencies (i.e. stores that also sell books as a supplementary product but mostly sell other not book-related items) and big bookstore chains in the heart of the city (such as Kinokuniya and Dymocks).\n\n<b>City layouts and the effects of rent.</b>\nEven though this analysis did not consider it, the rent of commercial areas in different suburbs should be taken into account in future analysis. This can account for why even though Sydney has a similar number of bookstores as Melbourne, yet visually on the maps, its bookstores are more spread out. That is, the Sydney bookstores are not situated as densely in its central business district as those of Melbourne's are, and this can be due to potentially higher rent in Sydney and perhaps its more sprawling layout as opposed to Melbourne's grid-system. The profit margins of bookstores are famously razor-thin and rely on a lot of floorstock. Thus in order to survive, bookstores need to be big (enough). However, the delicate balance between the size of a bookshop and the rent-per-square-footage may be thrown off by exorbitant city rents."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Conclusion\n\nFrom our regression analysis using Melbourne as a standard, we can conclude that Sydney has the population as well as the income to support at least 20 to 30 more bookstores within a 7.5km radius of its city centre.\n\nThis analysis can be improved by considering more factors, such as those listed in the discussion. Moreover, as well as being a retail institution, bookstores are also a cultural institution. This makes its sustainability and survivability harder to predict as it relies on people's personal habits.\n\nEver since the advent of big online book retailers - whose pushed-down prices have forced the closure of hundreds of bookstores worldwide -, it has been touted that the death of bookshops are upon us. However, two decades on, bookshops are still alive. And its only hope of surviving into the future is for more people to be willing to take a chance on them, either as customers or shop-owners."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
